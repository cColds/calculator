# Thoughts
This project was quite difficult for me. It was especially tricky implementing the logic to determine the first and second number. I did not code it in an efficient way at all. My code was also spaghetti. In hindsight (months after completing the project), it doesn't seem nearly as troublesome as before. Nonetheless, I've learned a lot from my mistakes. Perhaps I might try to redo this again in the future (and with keyboard support).
